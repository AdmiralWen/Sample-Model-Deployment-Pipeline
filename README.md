# Model Training & Deployment Pipeline Example

This repository contains some examples that can be used as a reference for training models and deploying them through .py modules. As of now, there are 2 sample models available:
1. Sample GLM: A relatively simple GLM model.
2. Sample XGB: A more complex XGBoost model that requires advanced feature transformations, such as missing values imputation and PCA.

For each model's directory, there is a .py file that has the full implementation of the model. There is also a .ipynb file that shows the model working on an example input.
